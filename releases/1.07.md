# What is notqmail?

_It's not qmail. It's also not netqmail._

We all use email, so we all use email servers. notqmail is software for running an [email server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent). Someday, if we do a good job, some of the many [articles about how and why to run your own](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/) will recommend notqmail.

[notqmail](http://notqmail.org) is a community-driven fork of [qmail](https://cr.yp.to/qmail.html), beginning where [netqmail](http://netqmail.org) left off: providing stable, compatible, small releases to which existing qmail users can safely update. notqmail also aims higher: developing an extensible, easily packaged, and increasingly useful modern mail server.

# What's new

This initial 1.07 release of notqmail is guided by two themes: **fix broken builds** and **make packaging easier**.

## Fix broken builds

- Support [utmpx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utmp) in [qbiff(1)](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/blob/master/qbiff.1) for systems that no longer provide utmp. ([[!template id=pr number=24]], [[!template id=pr number=29]], [#57](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/57)) 
- Append `.md` extensions to [INSTALL](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and [SENDMAIL](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/blob/master/SENDMAIL.md) to disambiguate from `install` and `sendmail` on case-insensitive filesystems, such as HFS+. ([#16](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/16))
- Enable BIND 8 API compatibility for systems with BIND 9 resolvers. ([#16](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/16))
- Work around macOS linker error by explicitly initializing a struct. ([#16](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/16))
- Add missing function arguments, includes, and Makefile dependencies. ([#1](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/1), [#20](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/20), [#31](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/31), [#53](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/53), [#55](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/55))

## Make packaging easier

- Fix builds on at least FreeBSD and macOS.
- Look up qmail's UIDs and GIDs at run time, not build time. ([#15](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/15))
- Optionally install as non-root, to a staging area, with DESTDIR. ([#4](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/4), [#15](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/15))

## Other changes

- Add TravisCI config. ([#19](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/19))
- Add `.gitignore`. ([#25](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/25))
- Remove [precompiled var-qmail package](https://cr.yp.to/qmail/var-qmail.html) support. ([#15](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/15))
- Remove `shar` target and `FILES`. ([#27](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/27))
- Remove `SYSDEPS`. ([#33](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/33))
- Replace `vfork()` with `fork()`, fixing macOS runtime. ([#38](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/38))
- Update documents and URLs for notqmail. ([#39](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/39), [#42](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/42))
