# [[1.08|notqmail 1.08]]
- [#35](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/35) FHS (issue [#2](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/2))
  - split conf-qmail in to conf-qmail-bin, conf-qmail-queue, conf-qmail-man, etc.
  - `/var/qmail/DIR` unless `/var/qmail` not in `conf-qmail`

    - deb and rpm builds.  (was issue [#59](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/59))
  - FHS-aware (default on): `/var/qmail` contains symlinks to FHS-compatible paths
  - FHS-strict (default off): `/var/qmail` does not exist
  - make packaging documentation optional.  ([#56](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/56) Don't install catted manpages)

  - Christopher K. Davis's [oversize DNS packet patch](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/compare/notqmail-dns-oversize)
- code standardization
  - Refactor the C code, by replacing valid K&R (The C Programming Language first edition) constructs with valid C89 (ANSI, The C Programming Language second edition) constructs, when there is a C89 feature that supersedes a construct in K&R.  (e.g., function signatures, adding int type specifiers.)  Even when a K&R construct is legal in C89.

      - [#84](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/84) use ssize_t in substdio library.
  - Fix all compiler warnings generated by warning settings consistent with the codebase being legal C89, and possibly informed by later C standards, to include at least the default `conf-cc`.
