The current release is [[notqmail-1.07]], released 19 Aug 2019.  notqmail is a fork of netqmail-1.06. The notqmail release roadmap:

# [[1.08|notqmail-1.08]]
- qmail-remote (extension interface preview)
  - [#46](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/46) Run alternate qmail-remote by setting QMAILREMOTE. (just like QMAILQUEUE.)
- [#35](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/35) FHS (issue [#2](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/2))
  - split conf-qmail in to conf-qmail-bin, conf-qmail-queue, conf-qmail-man, etc.
  - `/var/qmail/DIR` unless `/var/qmail` not in `conf-qmail`
  - Configuration sugar: `./configure && make && make install` (issue [#9](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/9))
- Debian (deb) and RedHat (rpm) packaging
  - [#76](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/76) binary builds on openSUSE build service and locally
    - deb and rpm builds.  (was issue [#59](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/59))
  - FHS-aware (default on): `/var/qmail` contains symlinks to FHS-compatible paths
  - FHS-strict (default off): `/var/qmail` does not exist
  - make packaging documentation optional.  ([#56](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/56) Don't install catted manpages)
  - [#61](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/61) Extract an "instqueue" program from instpackage.
- bugfixes
  - [#8](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/8) qmail-inject: do not parse header recipients if "-a" is given
  - [#18](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/18) qmail-remote: avoid recoding CRLF to CRCRLF
  - [#37](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/37) fix overflow in alloc.c
  - issue [#47](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/47) Don't let qmail-pop3d run as root

  - [Big DNS](https://www.ckdhr.com/ckd/qmail-103.patch)
- code standardization
  - Refactor the C code, by replacing valid K&R (The C Programming Language first edition) constructs with valid C89 (ANSI, The C Programming Language second edition) constructs, when there is a C89 feature that supersedes a construct in K&R.  (e.g., function signatures, adding int type specifiers.)  Even when a K&R construct is legal in C89.
    - headers
      - [#65](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/65) fix usage of most POSIX functions

  - Fix all compiler warnings generated by warning settings consistent with the codebase being legal C89, and possibly informed by later C standards, to include at least the default `conf-cc`.
    - correctness (undeclared function)
      - [#64](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/64) add missing forward declarations for project functions
      - [#78](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/78) remove unused variables.
