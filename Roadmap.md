The current release is [[notqmail 1.08]], released 20 May 2020.
notqmail is a fork of netqmail 1.06.
The notqmail release roadmap:


# [[1.09|Roadmap 1.09]]

- Remove 1.08's "intent to remove" programs (unless any of them make sense as extensions)
- [#35](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/35) FHS (issue [#2](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/2))
  - split conf-qmail in to conf-qmail-bin, conf-qmail-queue, conf-qmail-man, etc.
  - `/var/qmail/DIR` unless `/var/qmail` not in `conf-qmail`
  - Configuration sugar: `./configure && make && make install` (issue [#9](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/9))
- Debian (deb), RedHat (rpm), and /package packaging
  - [#76](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/76) binary builds on openSUSE build service and locally
    - deb and rpm builds.  (was issue [#59](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/59))
  - FHS-aware (default on): `/var/qmail` contains symlinks to FHS-compatible paths
  - FHS-strict (default off): `/var/qmail` does not exist
  - [#61](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/61) Extract an "instqueue" program from instpackage.
  - issue [#91](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/91) Include support for slashpackage-format packages
- bugfixes
  - [#18](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/18) qmail-remote: avoid recoding CRLF to CRCRLF

  - [#89](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/89) Fix leap second handling on systems running TAI ([original patch](https://su.bze.ro/software/netqmail-1.05-TAI-leapsecs.patch))
  - [#90](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/90) Improve Maildir file uniqueness in qmail-local.c ([original patch](https://su.bze.ro/software/qmail-1.03-maildir-uniq.patch))
  - Christopher K. Davis's [oversize DNS packet patch](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/compare/notqmail-dns-oversize)
  - [Sergio Gelato's fixed version of Andy Repton's outgoingip patch](http://qmailorg.schmonz.com/outgoingip.patch) to configure qmail-remote's IP in `control/outgoingip`
- code standardization
  - Refactor the C code, by replacing valid K&R (The C Programming Language first edition) constructs with valid C89 (ANSI, The C Programming Language second edition) constructs, when there is a C89 feature that supersedes a construct in K&R.  (e.g., function signatures, adding int type specifiers.)  Even when a K&R construct is legal in C89.
    - headers
      - [#65](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/65) fix usage of most POSIX functions

  - Fix all compiler warnings generated by warning settings consistent with the codebase being legal C89, and possibly informed by later C standards, to include at least the default `conf-cc`.
    - correctness (undeclared function)
      - [#77](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/77) use ANSI/C89 function signatures.
      - issue [#7](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues/7) Stop redeclaring system functions
