# notqmail

notqmail is a community-driven fork of [qmail](https://cr.yp.to/qmail.html), beginning where [netqmail](http://netqmail.org) left off: providing stable, compatible, small releases to which existing qmail users can safely update. notqmail also aims higher: developing an extensible, easily packaged, and increasingly useful modern mail server.
