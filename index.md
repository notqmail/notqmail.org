# notqmail

[notqmail](http://notqmail.org) is a community-driven fork of [qmail](https://cr.yp.to/qmail.html), beginning where [netqmail](http://netqmail.org) left off: providing stable, compatible, small releases to which existing qmail users can safely update. notqmail also aims higher: developing an extensible, easily packaged, and increasingly useful modern mail server.

The current release is [[notqmail 1.08|releases/1.08]], issued 20 May 2020.
