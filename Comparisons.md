notqmail is similar to some other projects. What makes it different enough to exist?

# notqmail and qmail

qmail has not been maintained for over two decades.

# notqmail and netqmail

netqmail has not been maintained for over a decade. notqmail is a fork of the final release of netqmail.

# notqmail and s/qmail

[s/qmail](https://www.fehcom.de/sqmail/sqmail.html) has been actively maintained for a long time. It ships with many modern features, some of which were developed independently by its maintainer, others of which came from popular patches being merged and then improved further. No public revision control repository is available.

notqmail is only a couple years old. Like its ancestors, it does not (yet) ship with many modern features. We want to, but it's more important to us to develop

1. In public
2. As a team
3. With consensus
4. Simple, qmail-inspired designs

Than it is to ship any particular feature on any particular timeline. If s/qmail didn't exist, it would be harder to justify setting these priorities for notqmail. We're grateful for s/qmail and we believe both projects being active and distinct is mutually beneficial to everyone who's still financially and/or emotionally invested in qmail.

# notqmail and postfix

Postfix has been actively maintained for a long time. For people not already involved with qmail, it's a sensible default choice.
