# Getting help

notqmail is discussed on the [qmail mailing list](https://cr.yp.to/lists.html#qmail) and on [Freenode's](https://freenode.net/) `#qmail` IRC channel.
For bug reports, please use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/issues) if possible.
For feature requests, please first refer to [Which features will eventually be implemented](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/wiki#which-features-will-eventually-be-implemented) and our [[roadmap]] for an idea of our current plans.
Then your rationale for how and why to change our plans -- which we are always open to -- will be more persuasive. :-)
