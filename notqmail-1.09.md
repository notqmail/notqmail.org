# What's new?

## Intent to remove

In the course of developing the previous releases, we found programs that we intend to remove in the next release. We believe none of these remains necessary or useful enough to be worth the cost of maintaining. If you disagree, please let us know!

- Remove qsmhook, long since replaced by preline. ([#87](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/87))
- Remove inefficient maildirwatch. ([#93](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/93))
- Remove obsolete mail client wrappers. ([#99](https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail/pull/99))
